  {
    question: "What types of room photos can I upload?",
    answer: "You can upload any indoor room photo in JPEG or PNG format. The system works best with clear, well-lit photos of bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, dining rooms, bathrooms, and study rooms. Make sure the photo shows the room clearly without too much blur."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI detect furniture?",
    answer: "RenoVision uses YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art Computer Vision model, to detect furniture items in your room photo. It identifies items like beds, sofas, chairs, TVs, refrigerators, and more with confidence scores. The higher the confidence score, the more certain the AI is about the detection."
  },
  {
    question: "How are renovation recommendations generated?",
    answer: "The Explainable AI (XAI) module analyzes your detected furniture, room type, budget and style preferences. It then applies a rule-based reasoning engine to generate personalized recommendations. Each recommendation includes a clear explanation of WHY it was suggested."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the budget slider control?",
    answer: "The budget slider sets your maximum renovation budget in Pakistani Rupees (Rs.). The system will only suggest renovations that fit within your budget. Higher budgets unlock more renovation options like false ceilings, modular kitchens, and premium furniture."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different design styles?",
    answer: "Modern: Clean lines, neutral colors, contemporary furniture. Classic: Warm tones, traditional furniture, elegant details. Minimalist: Simple, uncluttered, monochrome palette. Natural: Plants, wood textures, earthy tones. Industrial: Exposed brick, metal accents, raw textures."
  },
  {
    question: "How is the AI design image generated?",
    answer: "The GenAI module uses Stable Diffusion, an advanced AI image generation model, to create a visual preview of your renovated room based on your room type, style preference, budget tier and top recommendations. This gives you a visual idea of how your room could look after renovation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my uploaded photo stored anywhere?",
    answer: "No. Your uploaded room photo is processed immediately by the AI and then permanently deleted from the server. We do not store, share or use your photos for any other purpose. Your privacy is completely protected."
  },
  {
    question: "Why did the system not detect any furniture?",
    answer: "This can happen if: (1) The photo is too dark or blurry. (2) The room is very empty. (3) The furniture is very unusual or not in a standard style. Try uploading a clearer, brighter photo with more visible furniture items."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the renovation recommendations guaranteed?",
    answer: "No. RenoVision is a decision support tool — all recommendations are advisory only. Always consult a qualified interior designer or contractor before making any actual renovation decisions, especially for structural changes like walls, plumbing or electrical systems."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the analysis take?",
    answer: "Typically 20 to 60 seconds depending on your internet speed and server load. The Computer Vision analysis takes about 5-10 seconds. The AI image generation takes 20-50 seconds as it runs on cloud servers."
